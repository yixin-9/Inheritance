# Inheritance
 
 ### Description : 
 #### Inheritance- Container will be the base class while Vector and String will be the derived class, the children of Container. We separate the implementation from our interface by creating Vector.h, Vector.cpp, String.h, String.cpp,Container.h and an main.cpp as a driver.
